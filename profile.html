    <p> I lived in a small village, called Chaoqian, of Fujian for the first 15 years of my life.
    It is a very small village. Small enough for people to know each other. When I say people known each other, I mean when they see you, they know who your grandmother is. The village is surrounded by mountains and rivers. I had explored almost every mountain and river with my friends.
    Well, If you ask me, what are the unforgettable memories in this village, I would say, I almost died 3 times in the process of exploring mountains and rivers. I almost got bitten by a snake once, had fallen down from a small cliff, and nearly drowned once.
    It was a hot day in summer. My friends and I decided to picnic near a river, which is  It could be a great day until we decided to get into the water and have some fun. By the way, we are a group of 8, and only one of us kind of know how to swim.
